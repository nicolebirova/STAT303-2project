Oceanography: Salinity vs. Temperature of Water
In this project, we are looking for a relationship between ocean water salinity and temperature.
With this dataset, we can use the relationship to monitor the indicators of El Nino (warm phase of Pacific Ocean) and climate change. 
The questions we will answer are: Is there a relationship between water salinity & water temperature? 
Can you predict the water temperature based on salinity? 
Are there other factors that can also predict water temperature?

This is a regression analysis problem.

This is an inference problem.

We will assess model accuracy by identifying error bounds in the analysis through use of the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
because the RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors, which we want to make sure we donâ€™t miss in our analysis.

The data collected at depths down to 500 m include: temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, 
transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity. 
Because of this, we will need to do variable selection (starting off with just salinity and temperature) to find relationships 
between variables and to see whether there is an accurate predictor for temperature of the water.
